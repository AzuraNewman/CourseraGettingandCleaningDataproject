Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerationelerometer and gyroscopescope 3axial raw signals taccelerationXYZ and tgyroscopeXYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'timedomain' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the accelerationeleration signal was then separated into bodycomponent and gravitycomponent accelerationeleration signals (tbodycomponentaccelerationXYZ and tgravitycomponentaccelerationXYZ) using another low pass butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the bodycomponent linear accelerationeleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain jerk signals (timedomainbodycomponentaccelerationjerkXYZ and timedomainbodycomponentgyroscopejerkXYZ). Also the magnitude of these threedimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timedomainbodycomponentaccelerationMag, timedomaingravitycomponentaccelerationMag, timedomainbodycomponentaccelerationjerkMag, timedomainbodycomponentgyroscopeMag, timedomainbodycomponentgyroscopejerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencydomainbodycomponentaccelerationXYZ, frequencydomainbodycomponentaccelerationjerkXYZ, frequencydomainbodycomponentgyroscopeXYZ, frequencydomainbodycomponentaccelerationjerkMag, frequencydomainbodycomponentgyroscopeMag, frequencydomainbodycomponentgyroscopejerkMag. (Note the 'frequencydomain' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'XYZ' is used to denote 3axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravitycomponentMean
